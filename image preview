The image below is meant to represent the real addiction youth
has to social media because of the fake validation social sites
give teens. The image is supposed to reflect the "behind the
scenes" of the void social media creates. In order to do this,
I first started by finding a bedroom to use. I chose to use the
image I selected due to its darkness. I think this will help
represent the isolation social media can create. Second, I
chose a background color. Originally I was going to use a
solid black background, but I chose to use a background
that was mostly black with stars included. I did so because
after I blend the two images I feel that this will create
the effect of spiraling into nothingness, increasing
the feeling of isolation. Third, I added the sad boy
who is sitting on the bed. I chose this image because
the boy has his head in his knees, looks sad, and is shaded
in a blue/dark color. I felt all of these elements added to
the darkness of the picture. Lastly, I added the phone
and "like" notification in order to symbolize that
social media does not equate to true happiness.
I layered these pictures in this order because I felt
it was important to establish the tone of the picture
before I worked on the specific elements of the photo.
I plan to continue working on the image, specifically
by adding some text at the bottom to help
guide the viewers through the argument. I still
have a lot of work to do on the image, especially with
blending all the images together so they look cohesive.
My thought process behind the images I have started with
is to create the aura of my project first and then work
on the cohesiveness second.
